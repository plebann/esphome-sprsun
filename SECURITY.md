# Repository Security Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security Overview

This repository implements strict security measures to ensure only authorized users can commit changes. The security framework consists of multiple layers:

## Security Measures in Place

### 1. Code Ownership (CODEOWNERS)
- All files require approval from the repository owner (@plebann)
- Critical security files have explicit protection
- No changes can be merged without owner approval

### 2. Automated Security Checks
- **Security Check Workflow**: Validates commit authors and scans for potential secrets
- **PR Security Workflow**: Reviews pull requests from external contributors
- **Access Control**: Monitors and logs all repository access attempts

### 3. Commit Validation
- Verifies commit author identity
- Allows only authorized users and approved GitHub bots
- Blocks unauthorized direct commits to main branch

## For Repository Owner (plebann)

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Use Pull Requests**: Even as the owner, consider using PRs for better tracking
2. **Review All Changes**: Carefully review any external contributions
3. **Monitor Security Logs**: Check GitHub Actions logs regularly
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Use Dependabot for security updates

### Emergency Procedures
If unauthorized access is detected:
1. Check GitHub repository settings â†’ Manage access
2. Review recent commits and actions
3. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately
4. Contact GitHub support if needed

## For Contributors

### How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork
2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in a feature branch
3. **Submit Pull Request**: Create a PR against the main branch
4. **Wait for Review**: The repository owner will review all changes
5. **Address Feedback**: Make requested changes if needed

### What to Expect
- All external PRs require manual approval
- Security workflows will run automatically
- Thorough review process for all changes
- Communication via PR comments

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Commit author validation
- Secret pattern scanning
- Sensitive file change detection
- Pull request security analysis

### Manual Reviews
- All external contributions require manual review
- Critical file changes need explicit approval
- Security implications are carefully evaluated

## Branch Protection

While GitHub UI branch protection is recommended, this repository uses workflow-based protection:
- Main branch commits are monitored
- Unauthorized pushes are flagged
- Security checks run on all changes

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact the repository owner: @plebann

## Security Updates

This security framework will be updated as needed to address new threats and requirements. All changes to security measures will be documented and announced.
